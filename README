This project is a secure file transfer protcol. It's very similar to Apple Airdrop.
The appliaton uses a My-SQL database in AWS. All users of the application
credentials are stored in the database. I implemented a secure way to authenticate
each user.

The actual file transfer part is done using TCP sockets that I implemented. 

security practices such as encryption will be implemented to protect user credentials.
